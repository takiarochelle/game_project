# Creata a Buzzfeed style game.

# We will guess the user's birth month based off of their coffee preferences

# A one player game in which they will be asked a series of questions

# Ask the user for input on these :
    # 1. Pick a size: small, medium, large
    # 2. Pick iced or hot: iced, hot
    # 3. Do you add milk? y/n
    # 4. Pick a coffee shop: Starbucks, Peets, Philz, other

# Nice to Haves:

# Throw an error if they choose an invalid option
# Let the user play again
print "Create a coffee drink and we'll guess what month you were born in!"
